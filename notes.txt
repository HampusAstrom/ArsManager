TODOS
rename code in ars_manager.py to char_generator.py or so
make core ars_manager file that saves and loads data,
tracks a set of characters (and possibly groups them based on markers
like covenant, house and tribunal as well as order if not hermetic...)
ui should also be here or in a separate file called from here. Used to
generate characters, adjust them and re-generate parts of them, display
already made characters and their level progression and so on. Also to
rename abilitites with generic names and possibly hand change some stats
